\"ones\" often, but if there was ever a film that deserved this sort of attention, it's \"Gas!\" This is self-indulgent crap that reaches for some of the ambiance of M*A*S*H and falls completely flat on its face in the attempt.<br /><br />I see what Corman was going for - Malcolm Marmorstein and Elliott Gould tried to reproduce Gould's deathless role in the original movie version of M*A*S*H with a similar plot (in the movie \"Whiffs\" - look it up here in IMDb, http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073891/ for more information).<br /><br />Marmorstein and Gould got closer to the brass ring with \"Whiffs\" than Corman did with \"Gas!\" but didn't quite get there. Neither one of those films even got close to the success of M*A*S*H.<br /><br />What's wrong with \"Gas!\"? What isn't? No one comes close to really acting at a level above junior high school theatrics. The production values stink. Someone else here mentioned the magically regenerating headlights on a getaway car, and there's more of that lack of attention to detail. Nothing works the way it's supposed to in this film, and nobody cares.<br /><br />\"Gas!\" actually put me to sleep. It's not a sure cure for insomnia, but really close. On the Cinematic Sleep Induction scale, \"Gas!\" falls somewhere between \"Last Year at Marienbad\" and George Clooney's remake of \"Solaris\" (which itself was remarkable for being more boring than the Mosfilm original, despite that studio's seeming unfamiliarity with the idea of keeping the audience's attention by judicious editing).<br /><br />Judicious editing would have decimated \"Gas!\" to about twenty minutes. The result would be pointless, but no more so than the original film.<br /><br />Certain films are so bad that they have a compelling quality that makes them worth watching anyway. This isn't one of them. Don't waste your time. It's not even amusingly bad.\n","-----after processing\n","i dont hand out ones often but if there was ever a film that deserved this sort of attention its gas this is selfindulgent crap that reaches for some of the ambiance of mash and falls completely flat on its face in the attempt  i see what corman was going for  malcolm marmorstein and elliott gould tried to reproduce goulds deathless role in the original movie version of mash with a similar plot in the movie whiffs  look it up here in imdb  for more information  marmorstein and gould got closer to the brass ring with whiffs than corman did with gas but didnt quite get there neither one of those films even got close to the success of mash  whats wrong with gas what isnt no one comes close to really acting at a level above junior high school theatrics the production values stink someone else here mentioned the magically regenerating headlights on a getaway car and theres more of that lack of attention to detail nothing works the way its supposed to in this film and nobody cares  gas actually put me to sleep its not a sure cure for insomnia but really close on the cinematic sleep induction scale gas falls somewhere between last year at marienbad and george clooneys remake of solaris which itself was remarkable for being more boring than the mosfilm original despite that studios seeming unfamiliarity with the idea of keeping the audiences attention by judicious editing  judicious editing would have decimated gas to about twenty minutes the result would be pointless but no more so than the original film  certain films are so bad that they have a compelling quality that makes them worth watching anyway this isnt one of them dont waste your time its not even amusingly bad\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"neNDZrDvTs40"},"source":["# 問題6　Word2Vecの学習"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"El0XHV7_Ts40"},"source":["# 単語リスト\n","word_list = [after_preprocessing.split(' ')]\n","\n","# vector_size: 圧縮次元数\n","# min_count: 出現頻度の低いものをカットする\n","# window: 前後の単語を拾う際の窓の広さを決める\n","# epochs: 機械学習の繰り返し回数(デフォルト:5)十分学習できていないときにこの値を調整する\n","model = word2vec.Word2Vec(word_list,min_count=1) "],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"zRPiSYyzTs41","outputId":"1c3d5421-1283-4536-a4a7-5063fe9f3dda"},"source":["# 確認\n","model.wv['hand']"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["array([-0.00904435,  0.00534277,  0.00375054, -0.00605336,  0.00606624,\n","       -0.00113982,  0.00532705, -0.00198728,  0.00572351,  0.00578795,\n","       -0.00270007, -0.00911711, -0.00086151,  0.0028268 , -0.00730402,\n","       -0.00822396,  0.00099289,  0.00080993, -0.00464603, -0.00557673,\n","        0.00827145,  0.00953451, -0.00814784, -0.00735056,  0.0004159 ,\n","       -0.00356807, -0.00062897, -0.00580837, -0.00767971, -0.0048091 ,\n","        0.00368572,  0.00361012, -0.00872424, -0.00864171, -0.00645147,\n","        0.00244312, -0.00828653,  0.0004232 ,  0.00879883, -0.00906996,\n","       -0.00346835,  0.00891898,  0.00697609, -0.00029563, -0.00428081,\n","       -0.00887511, -0.00466706,  0.00085721,  0.0078073 , -0.00229957,\n","        0.00929993, -0.00791849,  0.00531931,  0.00555262, -0.00503432,\n","        0.00774953, -0.00636481,  0.00402099, -0.00960674, -0.000822  ,\n","       -0.00196953,  0.00656306,  0.00407827, -0.00955887, -0.0024127 ,\n","       -0.00562746, -0.00759491,  0.00170983,  0.0072332 , -0.00611929,\n","        0.00902302,  0.00319916, -0.00697173, -0.00032011,  0.0029974 ,\n","        0.00638828, -0.00026052,  0.00966439, -0.00452588, -0.00887171,\n","       -0.00833754,  0.0047477 , -0.00487187, -0.00876146, -0.00599027,\n","        0.00073023,  0.00869039, -0.00283584,  0.00388219, -0.0004528 ,\n","        0.0098864 ,  0.00488327, -0.00768637, -0.00985738, -0.00331965,\n","        0.00266926,  0.00528502,  0.00755208,  0.00391041,  0.00777833],\n","      dtype=float32)"]},"execution_count":125,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}]}]}
